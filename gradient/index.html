    <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>
      Features are the independent variables in a model. Here the observed temperature is a feature. Foot traffic
      depends on it. We use the symbol <b>x</b> for labels.
    </p>
    <h3>Label</h3>
    <p>
      A label is the observed effect. Here the actual foot traffic is the label. We
      will use the symbol <b>y</b> to represent a label.
    </p>
    <h3>Weight</h3>
    <p>Weight is the slope of the line we fit through the observed data samples. It measures how much
      effect a feature has on the label. We use the symbol
      <b>W</b> for it.
    </p>
    <h3>Bias</h3>
    <p>Bias is the y intercept of the line we fit through the data sample. We use the symbol
      <b>b</b> for it.</p>
    <h3>Prediction</h3>
    <p>This is the value of a label predicted by the line we fit through the data samples.
      We use the symbol <b>y'</b> or <b>y_</b> for it. Prediction is computed using the equation.
      $$
      y' = W \times x + b
      $$

      The goal of a model is to find the most optimal values of <b>W</b> and <b>b</b> that will give us the
      highest quality predictions. Sadly we can not use algebra to solve for <b>W</b> and <b>b</b> using a single equation.
    </p>
    <h3>Error or Cost</h3>
    <p>
      Error measures the accuracy of our predictions or how good a job we have done fitting the line through the observed data samples. We use the
      symbol <b>J</b> for it. Root Mean
      Square Error (RMSE) is a very effective and common way to measure the overall error of a model.
      It is calculated using this equation. Here <b>m</b> is the number of data samples.

      $$
      J = \frac{1}{2m} \sum (y - y')^{2}
      $$

      By replacing the value of <b>y'</b> we get.

      $$
      J = \frac{1}{2m} \sum (y - (W \times x + b))^{2}
      $$

      Here <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are the observed data points. This makes <b>J</b> solely a function of
      <b>W</b> and <b>b</b>. This equation is still not enough to solve for <b>W</b> and <b>b</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Various algorithms exist in Machine Learning (ML) that can approximately solve for <b>W</b> and <b>b</b>. 
      They do this by repeatedly trying out different values of <b>W</b> and <b>b</b> until we achieve an acceptable error value.
      This is called optimization or error minimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brute force optimizer can try out random values of <b>W</b> and <b>b</b> or try all
      possible combinations of them. But that will take immense computational power to solve even
      the simplest of cases. This is why reserchers have developed optimizers that make educated
      guesses and very quickly arrive at optimal values of <b>W</b> and <b>b</b>. Commonly used
      optimizers are:

      <ul>
        <li>Gradient Descent</li>
        <li>Adam</li>
        <li>Adagrad</li>
        <li>RMS Prop</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now look at <a target="_blank" href="training.html">Gradient Descent</a> in more details.
